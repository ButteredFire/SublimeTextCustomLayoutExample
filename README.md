# Sublime Text Custom Layout
The Python file above is a Sublime Text plugin that changes the default layout on startup. The code is self-documenting, complete with visualizations.

To add this file to Sublime Text:

1. Open Sublime Text and go to ```Tools > Developer > New Plugin...``` to create a new plugin file.
2. Copy and paste the code from the Python file above into the newly created plugin. Modify the code to your liking (but do not modify the function name), using the diagrams provided in the code as a guide. 
3. Press ```Ctrl + S``` to save the plugin.
4. Restart Sublime Text to see the new changes.

> [!NOTE]
> If there are still no changes after restarting Sublime Text, try saving the plugin in this directory: ```[OS DRIVE]:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text\Packages\``` (Outside of the ```User``` directory)
